M5LAB2 - Complete a Program
Name
Date

The program will ask the user to enter the width and length of a rectangle. It will then calculate the area. Finally it will display all three values in well formatted output.

The program will contain the following functions as well as main().

getLength - Asks the user to enter a rectangle's length, and return that value as a float.

getWidth - Asks the user to enter a rectangle's width, and return that value as a float.

getArea - This function should take two arguments, length and width. It will calculate the area and return that value as a float.

displayData - This function should take three arguments, length, width, and area. It will then display these values as well formatted output. (Something like "The length is: 5".)
